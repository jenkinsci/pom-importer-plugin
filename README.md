POM Importer Plugin for Jenkins
===============================

This plugin will allow you to create new Maven jobs based on an existing POM
file. Fields like SCM information and description can be determined from POMs,
so they can be pre-populated in the new job page and do not have to be
re-entered.

**NOTE:** *this plugin cannot be used currently!* It requires a change in
Jenkins core to allow plugins to add new options to the create job page. Which
will hopefully be possible soon :-)

This plugin was started as part of the Jenkins Hackathon at TNG in Munich on
June 30, 2011. A big Thank You to Andrew Bayer and Ullrich Haffner for putting
up with our newbie questions!
